# Overview

Our goal with this project was to create a mobile app that can send push notifications to a user's phone. We chose this to branch out from our previous programs that were entirely CRUD-based. We wanted to create a system that sends messages to a user instead of just receiving them. We also wanted to learn more about mobile app development.
