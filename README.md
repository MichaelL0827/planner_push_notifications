# Overview

Our goal with this project was to create a mobile app that can send push notifications to a user's phone. We chose this to branch out from our previous programs that were entirely CRUD-based. We wanted to create a system that sends messages to a user instead of just receiving them. We also wanted to learn more about mobile app development.

# Development Environment

We developed this app using .NET and .NET MAUI.

Our primary programming language was C#.

# Useful Websites
* [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui)

# Future Work
* Emulating the app on a PC
* Optimally configuring the development environment for .NET MAUI
